BibliQL
=======

> A GraphQL test designed to print out Quotes.

### Brief.

This API has been designed as a means of enveloping all information learned through the process of creating GraphQL API's, linking them to a Database and having queries and requests return. This is a work-in-progress API and will take some time to fully complete.

> The API has been left with some blanks for yourself to copy and fork to your local machine if you wish to try this.
> Please install Node before running this, then ensure you have installed all packages!

Ensure you have a valid MongoDB instance ready to read the quotes! (Note that I will leave a valid store of the quotes that you can then go ahead and push to your own MongoDB instance if you so desire.)
